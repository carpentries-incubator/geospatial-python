Data Carpentryâ€™s teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow. To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download
the data and install everything before working through this lesson.

The data used in this lesson includes optical satellite images from 
[the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission][sentinel-2] and public geographical datasets
from  [the dedicated distribution platform of the Dutch government][pdok].
These are real-world data sets that entail sufficient complexity to teach many
aspects of data analysis and management. They have been selected to allow students 
to focus on the core ideas and skills being taught while offering the chance
to encounter common challenges with geospatial data.
