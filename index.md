## Data Carpentries
[Data Carpentryâ€™s](https://datacarpentry.org/) teaching is hands-on. Participants are encouraged to use their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download the data and install everything before working through this lesson.

## Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python
In this lesson you will learn how to work with geospatial data and how to process these with python. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science and analytics, with a large and steadily growing community in the field of Earth and Space Sciences. The lesson is meant for participants with a working basic knowledge of Python and allow them to to familiarize with the world of geospatial raster and vector data. (If you are unfamiliar to python we recommend you to follow [this course](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) or have a look [here](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf) ). In the *Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python*  lesson you will be introduced to a set of tools from the Python ecosystem and learn how these can be used to carry out geospatial data analysis tasks. In particular, you will learn to work with  satellite images (i.e. [the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission][sentinel-2] ) and open topographical geo-datasets (i.e. [OpenStreetmap][osm]). You will learn how these spatial datasets can be accessed, explored, manipulated and visualized using Python.

## Case study - Wildfires
As a case study for this lesson we will focus on wildfires. According to the IPCC assessment report, the wildfire seasons are lengthening as a result of changes in temperature and increasing drought conditions [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/about/frequently-asked-questions/keyfaq1/). To analyse the impact of these wildfires, we will focus on the wildfire that occured on the Greek island [Rhodes in the summer of 2023](https://news.sky.com/story/wildfires-on-rhodes-force-hundreds-of-holidaymakers-to-flee-their-hotels-12925583), which led to the evacuation of [19.000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Greece_wildfires).

The analysis that you are going to work on is to estimate which built-up areas were affected by these wildfires. Furthermore, we will analyse which vegetation and land-use types have been affected the most by the wildfire in order to get an understanding of which areas are more vulnerable to wildfires. The latter will generate insights which can be used as input for wildfire mitigation strategies.

The data used in this lesson includes optical satellite images from [the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission][sentinel-2] and topgraphical data from [OpenStreetmap][osm]. These datasets are real-world open data sets that entail sufficient complexity to teach many aspects of data analysis and management. The datasets have been selected to allow participants to focus on the core ideas and skills being taught while offering the chance to encounter common challenges with geospatial data. Furthermore, we have selected datasets which are available anywhere on earth.

Note, that the analyses presented in this lesson are developed for educational purposes. Therefore in some occasions the analysis steps have been simplified and assumptions have been made.
