## Coordinate Reference Systems

A data structure cannot be considered geospatial unless it is accompanied by
coordinate reference system (CRS) information, in a format that geospatial
applications can use to display and manipulate the data correctly. CRS
information connects data to the Earth's surface using a mathematical model.

The CRS associated with a dataset tells your mapping software (for example Python)
where the raster is located in geographic space. It also tells the mapping
software what method should be used to flatten or project the raster in
geographic space.

the differences in shape associated with each projection. These differences are
a direct result of the calculations used to flatten the data onto a
2-dimensional map. (Source: opennews.org)

There are lots of great resources that describe coordinate reference systems and
projections in greater detail. For the purposes of this workshop, what is
important to understand is that data from the same location but saved in
different projections will not line up in any GIS or other program. Thus, it's
important when working with spatial data to identify the coordinate reference
system applied to the data and retain it throughout data processing and
analysis.

## Components of a CRS

CRS information has three components:

* **Datum:** A model of the shape of the earth. It has angular units (i.e.
degrees) and defines the starting point (i.e. where is [0,0]?) so the angles
reference a meaningful spot on the earth. Common global datums are WGS84 and
NAD83. Datums can also be local - fit to a particular area of the globe, but
ill-fitting outside the area of intended use. In this workshop, we will use the
[WGS84
datum](https://www.linz.govt.nz/data/geodetic-system/datums-projections-and-heights/geodetic-datums/world-geodetic-system-1984-wgs84).

* **Projection:** A mathematical transformation of the angular measurements on a
round earth to a flat surface (i.e. paper or a computer screen). The units
associated with a given projection are usually linear (feet, meters, etc.). In
this workshop, we will see data in two different projections.

* **Additional Parameters:** Additional parameters are often necessary to create
the full coordinate reference system. One common additional parameter is a
definition of the center of the map. The number of required additional
parameters depends on what is needed by each specific projection.

## Which projection should I use?

To decide if a projection is right for your data, answer these questions:  

  *  What is the area of minimal distortion?  
  *  What aspect of the data does it preserve?  

[Peter Dana from the University of Colorado at Boulder](https://foote.geography.uconn.edu/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html) and the [Department of Geo-Information Processing](https://kartoweb.itc.nl/geometrics/Map%20projections/mappro.html) has a good discussion of these aspects of projections. Online tools like [Projection Wizard](http://projectionwizard.org/) can also help you discover projections that might be a good fit for your data.  

> ## Data Tip

> Take the time to identify a projection that is suited for your project.
> You don't have to stick to the ones that are popular.

## Describing Coordinate Reference Systems  

There are several common systems in use for storing and transmitting CRS
information, as well as translating among different CRSs. These systems
generally comply with ISO 19111. Common systems for describing CRSs include
EPSG, OGC WKT, and PROJ strings.

# EPSG
The [EPSG system](https://epsg.org/home.html) is a database of CRS information maintained by the
International Association of Oil and Gas Producers. The dataset contains both CRS definitions and
information on how to safely convert data from one CRS to another. Using EPSG is easy as every
CRS has an integer identifier, e.g. WGS84 is EPSG:4326. The downside is that you can only use the
CRSs defined by EPSG and cannot customise them (some datasets do not have EPSG codes). [epsg.io](http://epsg.io/) is an 
excellent website for finding suitable projections by location or for finding information about a 
particular EPSG code.

# Well-Known Text
The Open Geospatial Consortium WKT standard is used by a number of important geospatial apps and 
software libraries. WKT is a nested list of geodetic parameters. The structure of the information is 
[defined on their website](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wkt-crs). WKT is valuable in
that the CRS information is more transparent than in EPSG, but can be more difficult to read and
compare than PROJ since it is meant to necessarily represent more complex CRS information. Additionally, 
the WKT standard is implemented inconsistently across various software platforms, and the spec itself has 
[some known issues](https://gdal.org/tutorials/wktproblems.html).

# PROJ
[PROJ](http://proj4.org/) is an open-source library for storing, representing
and transforming CRS information. PROJ strings continue to be used, but the format 
[is deprecated by the PROJ C maintainers](https://proj.org/faq.html#what-is-the-best-format-for-describing-coordinate-reference-systems) 
due to inaccuracies when converting to the WKT format. The data and 
python libraries we will be working with in this workshop use different 
underlying representations of CRSs under the hood for reprojecting. CRS 
information can still be represented with EPSG, WKT, or PROJ strings without 
consequence, but **it is best to only use PROJ strings as a format for viewing 
CRS information, not for reprojecting data**. 

PROJ represents CRS information as a text string of key-value pairs, which makes
it easy to read and interpret.

A PROJ4 string includes the following information: 

* **proj:** the projection of the data
* **zone:** the zone of the data (this is specific to the UTM projection)
* **datum:** the datum used
* **units:** the units for the coordinates of the data
* **ellps:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's  roundness is calculated) for
the data

Note that the zone is unique to the UTM projection. Not all CRSs will have a
zone.

## Format interoperability  

Many existing file formats were invented by GIS software developers, often in a
closed-source environment. This led to the large number of formats on offer today, and
considerable problems transferring data between software environments.
The [Geospatial Data Abstraction Library](http://www.gdal.org/) (GDAL) is an
open-source answer to this issue. 

GDAL is a set of software tools that translate between almost any geospatial format in
common use today (and some not so common ones). GDAL also contains tools for editing
and manipulating both raster and vector files, including reprojecting data to different
CRSs. GDAL can be used as a standalone command-line tool, or built in to other GIS
software. Several open-source GIS programs use GDAL for all file import/export
operations.

## Metadata  

Spatial data is useless without metadata. Essential metadata includes the CRS
information, but proper spatial metadata encompasses more than that. History and 
provenance of a dataset (how it was made), who is in charge of maintaining it, and
appropriate (and inappropriate!) use cases should also be documented in metadata. This
information should accompany a spatial dataset wherever it goes. In practice this can
be difficult, as many spatial data formats don't have a built-in place to hold this
kind of information. Metadata often has to be stored in a companion file, and 
generated and maintained manually.
