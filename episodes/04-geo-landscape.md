## Standalone Software Packages 

Most traditional GIS work is carried out in standalone applications that aim to provide
end-to-end geospatial solutions. These applications are available under a wide range of
licenses and price points. Some of the most common are listed below.

### Open-source software 

The [Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGEO)](http://www.osgeo.org/) supports several actively managed GIS platforms:

  * [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) is a professional GIS application that is
  built on top of and proud to be itself Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). QGIS is
  written in Python, has a python console interface, and has several interfaces written in R including
  [RQGIS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RQGIS). 
  * [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/), commonly referred to as GRASS 
  (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System), is a FOSS-GIS software suite used for
  geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps
  production, spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS GIS is currently used in
  academic and commercial settings around the world, as well as by many governmental
  agencies and environmental consulting companies. It is a founding member of the Open
  Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). GRASS GIS can be installed along with and made 
  accessible within QGIS 3.
  * [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) is a multiplatform
  set of tools for translating between geospatial data formats. It can also handle
  reprojection and a variety of geoprocessing tasks. GDAL is built in to many
  applications both FOSS and commercial, including GRASS and QGIS.
  * [SAGA-GIS](http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html), or System for Automated
  Geoscientific Analyses, is a FOSS-GIS application developed by a small team of
  researchers from the Dept. of Physical Geography, Göttingen, and the Dept. of
  Physical Geography, Hamburg. SAGA has been designed for an easy and effective
  implementation of spatial algorithms, offers a comprehensive, growing set of
  geoscientific methods, provides an easily approachable user interface with many
  visualisation options, and runs under Windows and Linux operating systems. Like 
  GRASS GIS, it can also be installed and made accessible in QGIS3.
  * [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) is a geospatial extension to the PostGreSQL
  relational database.

### Commercial software 

  * [ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute)](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)
  is an international supplier of geographic information system (GIS) software, web GIS
  and geodatabase management applications. ESRI provides several licenced platforms for
  performing GIS, including [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html), 
  [ArcGIS Online](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisonline), and 
  [Portal for ArcGIS](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/) a standalone version of
  ArGIS Online which you host locally. ESRI welcomes development on their platforms
  through their [DevLabs](https://developers.arcgis.com/). ArcGIS software can be
  installed using 
  [Chef Cookbooks from Github](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-cookbook).
  * Pitney Bowes produce [MapInfo Professional](https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/location-intelligence/geographic-information-systems/mapinfo-pro.html), 
  which was one of the earliest desktop GIS programs on the market. 
  * [Hexagon Geospatial Power Portfolio](https://www.hexagongeospatial.com/products/products) 
  includes many geospatial tools including ERDAS Imagine, powerful software for remote sensing.
  * [Manifold](http://www.manifold.net/) is a desktop GIS that emphasizes speed through
  the use of parallel and GPU processing. 

### Online + Cloud computing

  * [PANGEO](https://pangeo.io/) is a community organization dedicated to open and reproducible data science with python. 
  They focus on the Pangeo software ecosystem for working with big 
  data in the geosciences.
  * Google has created [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) which
  combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with
  planetary-scale analysis capabilities and makes it available for scientists,
  researchers, and developers to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences
  on the Earth's surface. [Earth Engine API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/) 
  runs in both Python and JavaScript.
  * [ArcGIS Online](http://www.arcgis.com/features/features.html) provides access to
  thousands of maps and base layers.

Private companies have released SDK platforms for large scale GIS analysis:

 * [Kepler.gl](http://kepler.gl/#/) is Uber's toolkit for handling large datasets (i.e. Uber's data archive).
 * [Boundless Geospatial](https://boundlessgeo.com/) is built upon OSGEO software for enterprise solutions. 

Publicly funded open-source platforms for large scale GIS analysis:

 * [PANGEO](http://pangeo.io/) for the Earth Sciences. This community organization also supports python libraries like xarray, iris, dask, jupyter, and many other packages.
 * [Sepal.io](https://sepal.io/) by [FAO Open Foris](http://www.openforis.org/) utilizing EOS satellite imagery and cloud resources for global forest monitoring.

## GUI vs CLI 

The earliest computer systems operated without a graphical user interface (GUI),
relying only on the command-line interface (CLI). Since mapping and spatial analysis
are strongly visual tasks, GIS applications benefited greatly from the emergence of
GUIs and quickly came to rely heavily on them. Most modern GIS applications have very
complex GUIs, with all common tools and procedures accessed via buttons and menus. 

Benefits of using a GUI include:

  - Tools are all laid out in front of you
  - Complex commands are easy to build
  - Don't need to learn a coding language
  - Cartography and visualisation is more intuitive and flexible
  
Downsides of using a GUI include:

  - Low reproducibility - you can't record your actions and replay
  - Most are not designed for batch-processing files
  - Limited ability to customise functions or write your own
  - Intimidating interface for new users - so many buttons!
  
In scientific computing, the lack of reproducibility in point-and-click software has
come to be viewed as a critical weakness. As such, scripted CLI-style workflows are
again becoming popular, which leads us to another approach to doing GIS — via a
programming language. This is the approach we will be using throughout this workshop.
  
## GIS in programming languages 

A number of powerful geospatial processing libraries exist for general-purpose
programming languages like Java and C++. However, the learning curve for these
languages is steep and the effort required is excessive for users who only need a
subset of their functionality. 

Higher-level scripting languages like Python and R are easier to learn and use. Both
now have their own packages that wrap up those geospatial processing libraries and make
them easy to access and use safely. A key example is the Java Topology Suite (JTS),
which is implemented in C++ as GEOS. GEOS is accessible in Python via the `shapely`
package (and `geopandas`, which makes use of `shapely`) and in R via `sf`. R and Python 
also have interface packages for GDAL, and for specific GIS apps. 

This last point is a huge advantage for GIS-by-programming; these interface packages
give you the ability to access functions unique to particular programs, but have your
entire workflow recorded in a central document - a document that can be re-run at will.
Below are lists of some of the key spatial packages for Python, which we will be using in the
remainder of this workshop.

  * `geopandas` and `geocube` for working with vector data 
  * `rasterio` and `rioxarray` for working with raster data

These packages along with the `matplotlib` package are all we need for spatial data visualisation. Python also has many fundamental scientific packages that are relevant in the geospatial domain. Below is a list of particularly fundamental packages. `numpy`, `scipy`, and `scikit-image` are all excellent options for working with rasters, as arrays.

An overview of these and other Python spatial packages can be [accessed here](https://medium.com/@chrieke/essential-geospatial-python-libraries-5d82fcc38731). 
  
As a programming language, Python can be a CLI tool. However, using
Python together with an [Integrated Development Environment](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide) (IDE) application
allows some GUI features to become part of your workflow. IDEs allow the best of both
worlds. They provide a place to visually examine data and other software objects,
interact with your file system, and draw plots and maps, but your activities are still
command-driven: recordable and reproducible. There are several IDEs available for Python.
[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) is well-developed and the most widely used option for data science 
in Python. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) and [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
are other popular options for data science.

Traditional GIS apps are also moving back towards providing a scripting environment for
users, further blurring the CLI/GUI divide. ESRI have adopted Python into their
software, and QGIS is both Python and R-friendly.

## GIS File Types 

There are a variety of file types that are used in GIS analysis. Depending on the program you choose to use some file
types can be used while others are not readable. Below is a brief table describing some of the most common vector and
raster file types.

### Vector

| File Type | Extensions | Description |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Esri Shapefile | .SHP .DBF .SHX | The most common geospatial file type. This has become the industry standard. The three required files are: SHP is the feature geometry. SHX is the shape index position. DBF is the attribute data. |
| Geographic JavaScript Object Notation (GeoJSON) | .GEOJSON .JSON |Used for web-based mapping and uses JavaScript Object Notation to store the coordinates as text. |
| Google Keyhole Markup Language (KML) | .KML .KMZ | KML stands for Keyhole Markup Language. This GIS format is XML-based and is primarily used for Google Earth. |
| OpenStreetMap | .OSM | OSM files are the native file for OpenStreetMap which had become the largest crowdsourcing GIS data project in the world. These files are a collection of vector features from crowd-sourced contributions from the open community. |

### Raster

| File Type | Extensions | Description |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| ERDAS Imagine | .IMG | ERDAS Imagine IMG files is a proprietary file format developed by Hexagon Geospatial. IMG files are commonly used for raster data to store single and multiple bands of satellite data.Each raster layer as part of an IMG file contains information about its data values. For example, this includes projection, statistics, attributes, pyramids and whether or not it’s a continuous or discrete type of raster. |
| GeoTIFF |.TIF .TIFF .OVR | The GeoTIFF has become an industry image standard file for GIS and satellite remote sensing applications. GeoTIFFs may be accompanied by other files:TFW is the world file that is required to give your raster geolocation.XML optionally accompany GeoTIFFs and are your metadata.AUX auxiliary files store projections and other information.OVR pyramid files improves performance for raster display. |
| Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) | .TIF .TIFF | Based on the GeoTIFF standard, COGs incorporate tiling and overviews to support HTTP range requests where users can query and load subsets of the image without having to transfer the entire file. |
