## Raster Data

In the [first episode](01-intro-raster-data.md) of this course we provided an introduction on what Raster datasets are and how these divert from vector data. In this episode we will dive more into raster data and focus on how to work with them. We introduce fundamental principles, python packages, metadata and raster attributes for working with this type of data. In addition, we will explore how Python handles missing and bad data values.

The Python package we will use throughout this episode to handle raster data is [`rioxarray`](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/). This package is based on the popular [`rasterio`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package for working with raster data and [`xarray`](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) for working with multi-dimensional arrays.

`Rioxarray` extends `xarray` by providing top-level functions like the [`open_rasterio`](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/html/rioxarray.html#rioxarray-open-rasterio) function to open raster datasets. Furthermore, it adds a set of methods to the main objects of the `xarray` package like the [`Dataset`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html) and the [`DataArray`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.html#xarray.DataArray). These methods are made available via the `rio` accessor and become available from `xarray` objects after importing `rioxarray`.

*[comment_mdk]: what do we mean with the "rio accessor"? Furthermore, it is unclear in this text what the advantages are of dataset and dataarray, why are these interesting for us? We should explain that.*

In addition, we will use the [`pystac`](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac) package to load rasters from the search results that were created in [episode 5](05-access-data.md).

:::

## Getting the data

We will continue from the results of the satellite image search that we have carried out in an exercise from
[the previous episode](05-access-data.md). We will load data using the created metadata file and use one scene from the search results as an example to demonstrate data loading and visualization. To do so you can use the `rhodes_sentinel-2.json` you created or download and use the created JSON file [here](../data/stac_json/rhodes_sentinel-2.json).

In case you would like to work with raster data for this lesson without downloading data on-the-fly, you can download the raster data using this [link](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/36028100). Save the `geospatial-python-raster-dataset.tar.gz` file in your current working directory, and extract the archive file by double-clicking on it or by running the
following command in your terminal `tar -zxvf geospatial-python-raster-dataset.tar.gz`.

*[comment mdk]: update zip file [link](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/36028100)*
If you use choose to download the data you can skip the following part and continue at chapter XXXX.

When you use the `rhodes_sentinel-2.json` you will remember that this file contains information on where and how to access the target images from a remote repository. To load the saved search results as an `Item` list we will use [`pystac.ItemCollection.from_file()`](https://pystac.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/item_collection.html). Through this, we are instructing Python to use the `from_file` method of the `ItemCollection` class in the `pystac` module to load data from a specified JSON file.

```python
import pystac
file_items = pystac.ItemCollection.from_file("../data/stac_json/rhodes_sentinel-2.json")
```
In the search results, we have eleven `Item` type objects, corresponding to the Sentinel-2 scenes parameters we set in episode 5 (which were all images from July 8th till the 27th of August 2023 that have less than 1% cloud coverage). In this episode we will focus on the oldest item in our collection, since that would show the situation before the wildfire.

Like when reading the data from the api we can perform the same actions on the collection since it is stored to the class ItemColleciton. For instance, you can check the number of items in the item collection, you can use `len` or to check the items themselved include a for loop.

```python
print(len(file_items))
```
To check the items themselves you can make a for loop on the items (as we did in episode 5). To look at specific parameters of the item you can have a look [here](https://pystac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/item.html). Since we are interested in the most recent image let us print the `datetime` and `id`:

```python
for item in file_items:
    print(item.id)
    print(item.datetime)
```

You will notice that the item collection `S2A_35SNA_20230708_0_L2A` would be the oldest since it is printed as last.

```python
print(file_items[-1])
```

```output
<Item id=S2A_35SNA_20230708_0_L2A>
```

To access an actual raster image from that date we look at the itemÂ´s attribute `assets` which is accessible through a dictionary. This contains all the various datasets that have been collected at that specific date.

```python
assets = file_items[-1].assets
print(assets.keys())
```

```output
dict_keys(['aot', 'blue', 'coastal', 'granule_metadata', 'green', 'nir', 'nir08', 'nir09', 'red', 'rededge1', 'rededge2', 'rededge3', 'scl', 'swir16', 'swir22', 'thumbnail', 'tileinfo_metadata', 'visual', 'wvp', 'aot-jp2', 'blue-jp2', 'coastal-jp2', 'green-jp2', 'nir-jp2', 'nir08-jp2', 'nir09-jp2', 'red-jp2', 'rededge1-jp2', 'rededge2-jp2', 'rededge3-jp2', 'scl-jp2', 'swir16-jp2', 'swir22-jp2', 'visual-jp2', 'wvp-jp2']
```

To analyse the burned areas, we are interested in the `red` band of the satellite scene. In [episode 9](/episodes/09-raster-calculations.md) we will further explain why the characteristics of that band are interesting in relation to wildfires.

To select the red band we need to get the URL / `href` (Hypertext Referenc) and put it into a variable.

```python
rhodes_red_href = assets["red"].href
```

```python
print(rhodes_red_href)
```

## Load a Raster and View Attributes

Now we can load `red` band using the function [`rioxarray.open_rasterio()`](), via the variable we created.

```python
import rioxarray
rhodes_red = rioxarray.open_rasterio(rhodes_red_href)
```

In case you used the downloaded data you can do.

```python
import rioxarray
rhodes_red = rioxarray.open_rasterio("../data/stac_json/rhodes_red.tif")
```

The first call to `rioxarray.open_rasterio()` opens the file from remote or local storage, and then returns a `xarray.DataArray` object. The object is stored in a variable, i.e. `rhodes_red`. Reading in the data with `xarray` instead of `rioxarray` also returns a `xarray.DataArray`, but the output will not contain the geospatial metadata (such as projection information). You can use numpy functions or built-in Python math operators on a `xarray.DataArray` just like a numpy array. Calling the variable name of the `DataArray` also prints out all of its metadata information.

By calling the variable name we can get a quick look at the shape and attributes of the data.
```python
print(rhodes_red)
```

```output
<xarray.DataArray (band: 1, y: 10980, x: 10980)> Size: 241MB
[120560400 values with dtype=uint16]
Coordinates:
  * band         (band) int32 4B 1
  * x            (x) float64 88kB 5e+05 5e+05 5e+05 ... 6.098e+05 6.098e+05
  * y            (y) float64 88kB 4.1e+06 4.1e+06 4.1e+06 ... 3.99e+06 3.99e+06
    spatial_ref  int32 4B 0
Attributes:
    AREA_OR_POINT:       Area
    OVR_RESAMPLING_ALG:  AVERAGE
    _FillValue:          0
    scale_factor:        1.0
    add_offset:          0.0
```

The output tells us that we are looking at an `xarray.DataArray`, with `1` band, `10980` rows, and `10980` columns. We can also see the number of pixel values in the `DataArray`, and the type of those pixel values, which is unsigned integer (or `uint16`). The `DataArray` also stores different values for the coordinates of the `DataArray`. When using `rioxarray`, the term coordinates refers to spatial coordinates like `x` and `y` but also the `band` coordinate. Each of these sequences of values has its own data type, like `float64` for the spatial coordinates and `int64` for the `band` coordinate.

This `DataArray` object also has a couple of attributes that are accessed like `.rio.crs`, `.rio.nodata`, and `.rio.bounds()` (in jupyter you can browse through these attributes by using `tab` for auto completion or have a look at the documentation [here](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/rioxarray.html#rioxarray-rio-accessors)), which contains the metadata for the file we opened. Note that many of the metadata are accessed as attributes without `()`, however since `bounds()` is a method (i.e. a function in an object) it requires these parentheses this is also the case for `.rio.resolution()`.

```python
print(rhodes_red.rio.crs)
print(rhodes_red.rio.nodata)
print(rhodes_red.rio.bounds())
print(rhodes_red.rio.width)
print(rhodes_red.rio.height)
print(rhodes_red.rio.resolution())
```

```output
EPSG:9122
0
(499980.0, 3990240.0, 609780.0, 4100040.0)
10980
10980
(10.0, -10.0)
```

The Coordinate Reference System, or `rhodes_red.rio.crs`, is reported as the string `EPSG:9122`. The `nodata` value is encoded as 0 and the bounding box corners of our raster are represented by the output of `.bounds()` as a `tuple` (like a list but you can't edit it). The height and width match what we saw when we printed the `DataArray`, but by using `.rio.width` and `.rio.height` we can access these values if we need them in calculations.

## Visualize a Raster

After viewing the attributes of our raster, we can examine the raw values of the array with `.values`:

```python
rhodes_red.values
```

```output
array([[[    0,     0,     0, ...,  8888,  9075,  8139],
        [    0,     0,     0, ..., 10444, 10358,  8669],
        [    0,     0,     0, ..., 10346, 10659,  9168],
        ...,
        [    0,     0,     0, ...,  4295,  4289,  4320],
        [    0,     0,     0, ...,  4291,  4269,  4179],
        [    0,     0,     0, ...,  3944,  3503,  3862]]], dtype=uint16)
```

This can give us a quick view of the values of our array, but only at the corners. Since our raster is loaded in python as a `DataArray` type, we can plot this in one line similar to a pandas `DataFrame` with `DataArray.plot()`.

```python
rhodes_red.plot()
```

![Raster plot with rioxarray](fig/E06/overview-plot-B09.png){alt="raster plot with defualt setting"}

Notice that `rioxarray` helpfully allows us to plot this raster with spatial coordinates on the x and y axis (this is not the default in many cases with other functions or libraries). Nice plot! However, it probably took a while for it to load therefore it would make sense to resample it.

# Resampling the raster image

The red band image is available as a raster file with 10 m resolution, which makes it a relatively large file (few hundreds MBs).
In order to keep calculations "manageable" (reasonable execution time and memory usage) we select here a lower resolution version of the image, taking
advantage of the so-called "pyramidal" structure of cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs). COGs, in fact, typically include
multiple lower-resolution versions of the original image, called "overviews", in the same file. This allows us to avoid
downloading high-resolution images when only quick previews are required.

Overviews are often computed using powers of 2 as down-sampling (or zoom) factors. So, typically, the first level
overview (index 0) corresponds to a zoom factor of 2, the second level overview (index 1) corresponds to a zoom factor
of 4, and so on. Here, we open the third level overview (index 2, zoom factor 8) and check that the resolution is about 80 m:

```python
import rioxarray
rhodes_red_80 = rioxarray.open_rasterio(red_href, overview_level=2)
print(rhodes_red_80.rio.resolution())
```

```output
(79.97086671522214, -79.97086671522214)
```
Lets plot this one.

```python
rhodes_red_80.plot()
```

This plot shows the satellite measurement of the band `red` for Rhodes before the wildfire. According to the [Sentinel-2 documentaion](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/msi-instrument), this is a band with the central wavelength of 665nm. It has a spatial resolution of 10m. Note that the `band=1` in the image title refers to the ordering of all the bands in the  `DataArray`, not the Sentinel-2 band number `04` that we saw in the pystac search results.

![Raster plot using the "robust" setting](fig/E06/overview-plot-B09-robust.png){alt="raster plot with robust setting"}

Now the color limit is set in a way fitting most of the values in the image. We have a better view of the ground pixels.

:::callout
## Tool Tip
The option `robust=True` always forces displaying values between the 2nd and 98th percentile. Of course, this will not work for every case.

```python
rhodes_red_80.plot(robust=True)
```

For a customized displaying range, you can also manually specifying the keywords `vmin` and `vmax`. For example ploting between `100` and `7000`:

```python
rhodes_red.plot(vmin=100, vmax=7000)
```
More options can be consulted [here](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/v2024.02.0/generated/xarray.plot.imshow.html). You will notice that these parameters are part of the `imshow` method from the plot function. Since plot originates from matplotlib and is so widely used, your python environment helps you to interpret the parameters without having to specify the method. It is a service to help you, but can be confusing when teaching it. We will explain more about this below.

:::

## View Raster Coordinate Reference System (CRS) in Python
Another information that we're interested in is the CRS, and it can be accessed with `.rio.crs`. We introduced the concept of a CRS in [an earlier
episode](03-crs.md).
Now we will see how features of the CRS appear in our data file and what
meanings they have. We can view the CRS string associated with our DataArray's `rio` object using the `crs`
attribute.

```python
print(raster_ams_b9.rio.crs)
```

```output
EPSG:32631
```

To print the EPSG code number as an `int`, we use the `.to_epsg()` method:

```python
raster_ams_b9.rio.crs.to_epsg()
```

```output
32631
```


EPSG codes are great for succinctly representing a particular coordinate reference system. But what if we want to see more details about the CRS, like the units? For that, we can use `pyproj`, a library for representing and working with coordinate reference systems.

```python
from pyproj import CRS
epsg = raster_ams_b9.rio.crs.to_epsg()
crs = CRS(epsg)
crs
```

```output
<Derived Projected CRS: EPSG:32631>
Name: WGS 84 / UTM zone 31N
Axis Info [cartesian]:
- E[east]: Easting (metre)
- N[north]: Northing (metre)
Area of Use:
- name: Between 0Â°E and 6Â°E, northern hemisphere between equator and 84Â°N, onshore and offshore. Algeria. Andorra. Belgium. Benin. Burkina Faso. Denmark - North Sea. France. Germany - North Sea. Ghana. Luxembourg. Mali. Netherlands. Niger. Nigeria. Norway. Spain. Togo. United Kingdom (UK) - North Sea.
- bounds: (0.0, 0.0, 6.0, 84.0)
Coordinate Operation:
- name: UTM zone 31N
- method: Transverse Mercator
Datum: World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble
- Ellipsoid: WGS 84
- Prime Meridian: Greenwich
```

The `CRS` class from the `pyproj` library allows us to create a `CRS` object with methods and attributes for accessing specific information about a CRS, or the detailed summary shown above.

A particularly useful attribute is `area_of_use`, which shows the geographic bounds that the CRS is intended to be used.

```python
crs.area_of_use
```

```output
AreaOfUse(west=0.0, south=0.0, east=6.0, north=84.0, name='Between 0Â°E and 6Â°E, northern hemisphere between equator and 84Â°N, onshore and offshore. Algeria. Andorra. Belgium. Benin. Burkina Faso. Denmark - North Sea. France. Germany - North Sea. Ghana. Luxembourg. Mali. Netherlands. Niger. Nigeria. Norway. Spain. Togo. United Kingdom (UK) - North Sea.')
```

:::challenge
## Exercise: find the axes units of the CRS
What units are our data in? See if you can find a method to examine this information using `help(crs)` or `dir(crs)`

::::solution
`crs.axis_info` tells us that the CRS for our raster has two axis and both are in meters.
We could also get this information from the attribute `raster_ams_b9.rio.crs.linear_units`.
::::
:::

### Understanding pyproj CRS Summary
Let's break down the pieces of the `pyproj` CRS summary. The string contains all of the individual CRS elements that Python or another GIS might need, separated into distinct sections, and datum.

```output
<Derived Projected CRS: EPSG:32631>
Name: WGS 84 / UTM zone 31N
Axis Info [cartesian]:
- E[east]: Easting (metre)
- N[north]: Northing (metre)
Area of Use:
- name: Between 0Â°E and 6Â°E, northern hemisphere between equator and 84Â°N, onshore and offshore. Algeria. Andorra. Belgium. Benin. Burkina Faso. Denmark - North Sea. France. Germany - North Sea. Ghana. Luxembourg. Mali. Netherlands. Niger. Nigeria. Norway. Spain. Togo. United Kingdom (UK) - North Sea.
- bounds: (0.0, 0.0, 6.0, 84.0)
Coordinate Operation:
- name: UTM zone 31N
- method: Transverse Mercator
Datum: World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble
- Ellipsoid: WGS 84
- Prime Meridian: Greenwich
```

* **Name** of the projection is UTM zone 31N (UTM has 60 zones, each 6-degrees of longitude in width). The underlying datum is WGS84.
* **Axis Info**: the CRS shows a Cartesian system with two axes, easting and northing, in meter units.
* **Area of Use**: the projection is used for a particular range of longitudes `0Â°E to 6Â°E` in the northern hemisphere (`0.0Â°N to 84.0Â°N`)
* **Coordinate Operation**: the operation to project the coordinates (if it is projected) onto a cartesian (x, y) plane. Transverse Mercator is accurate for areas with longitudinal widths of a few degrees, hence the distinct UTM zones.
* **Datum**: Details about the datum, or the reference point for coordinates. `WGS 84` and `NAD 1983` are common datums. `NAD 1983` is [set to be replaced in 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datum_of_2022).

Note that the zone is unique to the UTM projection. Not all CRSs will have a
zone. Below is a simplified view of US UTM zones.

![The UTM zones across the continental United States (Chrismurf at English Wikipedia, via [Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#/media/File:Utm-zones-USA.svg) (CC-BY))](fig/E03/Utm-zones-USA.svg){alt="UTM zones across the CONUS"}

## Calculate Raster Statistics

It is useful to know the minimum or maximum values of a raster dataset. We can compute these and other descriptive statistics with `min`, `max`, `mean`, and `std`.

```python
print(raster_ams_b9.min())
print(raster_ams_b9.max())
print(raster_ams_b9.mean())
print(raster_ams_b9.std())
```

```output
<xarray.DataArray ()>
array(0, dtype=uint16)
Coordinates:
    spatial_ref  int64 0
<xarray.DataArray ()>
array(15497, dtype=uint16)
Coordinates:
    spatial_ref  int64 0
<xarray.DataArray ()>
array(1652.44009944)
Coordinates:
    spatial_ref  int64 0
<xarray.DataArray ()>
array(2049.16447495)
Coordinates:
    spatial_ref  int64 0
```


The information above includes a report of the min, max, mean, and standard deviation values, along with the data type. If we want to see specific quantiles, we can use xarray's `.quantile()` method. For example for the 25% and 75% quantiles:

```python
print(raster_ams_b9.quantile([0.25, 0.75]))
```

```output
<xarray.DataArray (quantile: 2)>
array([   0., 2911.])
Coordinates:
  * quantile  (quantile) float64 0.25 0.75
```

:::callout
## Data Tip - NumPy methods
You could also get each of these values one by one using `numpy`.

```python
import numpy
print(numpy.percentile(raster_ams_b9, 25))
print(numpy.percentile(raster_ams_b9, 75))
```

```output
0.0
2911.0
```

You may notice that `raster_ams_b9.quantile` and `numpy.percentile` didn't require an argument specifying the axis or dimension along which to compute the quantile. This is because `axis=None` is the default for most numpy functions, and therefore `dim=None` is the default for most xarray methods. It's always good to check out the docs on a function to see what the default arguments are, particularly when working with multi-dimensional image data. To do so, we can use`help(raster_ams_b9.quantile)` or `?raster_ams_b9.percentile` if you are using jupyter notebook or jupyter lab.
:::

## Dealing with Missing Data
So far, we have visualized a band of a Sentinel-2 scene and calculated its statistics. However, we need to take missing data into account. Raster data often has a "no data value" associated with it and for raster datasets read in by `rioxarray`. This value is referred to as `nodata`. This is a value assigned to pixels where data is missing or no data were collected. There can be different cases that cause missing data, and it's common for other values in a raster to represent different cases. The most common example is missing data at the edges of rasters.

By default the shape of a raster is always rectangular. So if we have a dataset that has a shape that isn't rectangular, some pixels at the edge of the raster will have no data values. This often happens when the data were collected by a sensor which only flew over some part of a defined region.

As we have seen above, the `nodata` value of this dataset (`raster_ams_b9.rio.nodata`) is 0. When we have plotted the band data, or calculated statistics, the missing value was not distinguished from other values. Missing data may cause some unexpected results. For example, the 25th percentile we just calculated was 0, probably reflecting the presence of a lot of missing data in the raster.

To distinguish missing data from real data, one possible way is to use `nan` to represent them. This can be done by specifying `masked=True` when loading the raster:
```python
raster_ams_b9 = rioxarray.open_rasterio(items[0].assets["nir09"].href, masked=True)
```


One can also use the `where` function to select all the pixels which are different from the `nodata` value of the raster:
```python
raster_ams_b9.where(raster_ams_b9!=raster_ams_b9.rio.nodata)
```


Either way will change the `nodata` value from 0 to `nan`. Now if we compute the statistics again, the missing data will not be considered:
```
print(raster_ams_b9.min())
print(raster_ams_b9.max())
print(raster_ams_b9.mean())
print(raster_ams_b9.std())
```python

```output
<xarray.DataArray ()>
array(8., dtype=float32)
Coordinates:
    spatial_ref  int64 0
<xarray.DataArray ()>
array(15497., dtype=float32)
Coordinates:
    spatial_ref  int64 0
<xarray.DataArray ()>
array(2477.405, dtype=float32)
Coordinates:
    spatial_ref  int64 0
<xarray.DataArray ()>
array(2061.9539, dtype=float32)
Coordinates:
    spatial_ref  int64 0
```


And if we plot the image, the `nodata` pixels are not shown because they are not 0 anymore:

![Raster plot after masking out missing values](fig/E06/overview-plot-B09-robust-with-nan.png){alt="raster plot masking missing values"}

One should notice that there is a side effect of using `nan` instead of `0` to represent the missing data: the data type of the `DataArray` was changed from integers to float. This need to be taken into consideration when the data type matters in your application.

## Raster Bands
So far we looked into a single band raster, i.e. the `nir09` band of a Sentinel-2 scene. However, to get a smaller, non georeferenced version of the scene, one may also want to visualize the true-color overview of the region. This is provided as a multi-band raster -- a raster dataset that contains more than one band.

![Sketch of a multi-band raster image](fig/E06/single_multi_raster.png){alt="multi-band raster"}

The `overview` asset in the Sentinel-2 scene is a multiband asset. Similar to `nir09`, we can load it by:
```python
raster_ams_overview = rioxarray.open_rasterio(items[0].assets['visual'].href, overview_level=3)
raster_ams_overview
```

```output
<xarray.DataArray (band: 3, y: 687, x: 687)>

The band number comes first when GeoTiffs are read with the `.open_rasterio()` function. As we can see in the `xarray.DataArray` object, the shape is now `(band: 3, y: 687, x: 687)`, with three bands in the `band` dimension. It's always a good idea to examine the shape of the raster array you are working with and make sure it's what you expect. Many functions, especially the ones that plot images, expect a raster array to have a particular shape. One can also check the shape using the `.shape` attribute:
```python
raster_ams_overview.shape
```

```output
(3, 687, 687)
```

One can visualize the multi-band data with the `DataArray.plot.imshow()` function:
```python
raster_ams_overview.plot.imshow()
```

Note that the `DataArray.plot.imshow()` function makes assumptions about the shape of the input DataArray, that since it has three channels, the correct colormap for these channels is RGB. It does not work directly on image arrays with more than 3 channels. One can replace one of the RGB channels with another band, to make a false-color image.

:::challenge
## Exercise: set the plotting aspect ratio
As seen in the figure above, the true-color image is stretched. Let's visualize it with the right aspect ratio. You can use the [documentation](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.plot.imshow.html) of `DataArray.plot.imshow()`.

::::solution
Since we know the height/width ratio is 1:1 (check the `rio.height` and `rio.width` attributes), we can set the aspect ratio to be 1. For example, we can choose the size to be 5 inches, and set `aspect=1`. Note that according to the [documentation](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.plot.imshow.html) of `DataArray.plot.imshow()`, when specifying the `aspect` argument, `size` also needs to be provided.

```python
raster_ams_overview.plot.imshow(size=5, aspect=1)
```

:::keypoints
- `rioxarray` and `xarray` are for working with multidimensional arrays like pandas is for working with tabular data.
- `rioxarray` stores CRS information as a CRS object that can be converted to an EPSG code or PROJ4 string.
- Missing raster data are filled with nodata values, which should be handled with care for statistics and visualization.
