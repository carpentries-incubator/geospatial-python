## Instructor notes

## Workshop Structure

The following table provides the structure for the Geospatial Workshop and *estimated* timings for each lesson.

| Lesson  | Length  | Include if: |
|---|---|---|
| [Introduction to Geospatial Concepts](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/) ([instructor notes](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/guide/index.html))   | **75 minutes** - estimated, will not be accurate  | Learners have no experience with geospatial data.  |
| [Introduction to R for Geospatial Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/) ([instructor notes](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/guide/index.html))  | **4 hours** - estimated, will not be accurate  | Learners have no experience with R.  |
| [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/) ([instructor notes](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/guide/index.html))  | **7 hours** - estimated, will not be accurate  | Always.  |

If the workshop audience is experienced in both R and geospatial concepts, this workshop could theoretically be taught in one day. However, note that these timings are estimates and we are relying on feedback from pilot workshop Instructors to add accurate timing information.

[Instructors: add information about timing and selecting materials as these workshops are piloted]

## Technical tips and tricks

#### Installation
- For the [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/) lesson, learners MUST download the data and install the software before the workshop. The data set is large (>150 Mb) and there are numerous software packages and R libraries to install. **Remind your learners multiple times!**
  - Instructions to download data and set up a machine to analyze and process geospatial data: http://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/setup.html
- You may find it helpful to host an "install party" prior to your workshop where you and your co-instructors help learners install the necessary software for the workshop. If this is unfeasible, leave time at the beginning of your workshop to ensure that learners have necessary geospatial software (GDAL, GEOS, PROJ.4) installed prior to teaching the course.
