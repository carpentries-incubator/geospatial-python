## The Lesson
Check out https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/ to view the lesson as it currently stands. Episodes 1-7 and Episode 12 are currently complete. Epsiodes 1-7 have been taught previously in workshop settings, read more about that experience and feedback [here](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/03/teaching-a-new-geospatial-python-lesson/). Other episodes still need to be fleshed out and we welcome contributions!

## Thanks Geospatial R Authors!
This lesson would not be possible without the many contributions from the authors of the [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R](https://github.com/datacarpentry/r-raster-vector-geospatial) and [Introduction to Geospatial Concepts](https://github.com/datacarpentry/organization-geospatial) lessons. These lessons have served as templates for this geospatial python lesson.
