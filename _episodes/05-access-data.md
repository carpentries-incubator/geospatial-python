# Introduction

A number of satellites take snapshots of the Earth's surface from space. The images recorded by these remote sensors
represent a very precious data source for any activity that involves monitoring changes on Earth. Satellite imagery is
typically provided in the form of geospatial raster data, with the measurements in each grid cell ("pixel") being
associated to accurate geographic coordinate information.

In this episode we will explore how to access open satellite data using Python. In particular,  we will
consider [the Sentinel-2 data collection that is hosted on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2-l2a-cogs).
This dataset consists of multi-band optical images acquired by the two satellites of
[the Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) and it is continuously updated with
new images.

# Search for satellite imagery

## The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification

Current sensor resolutions and satellite revisit periods are such that terabytes of data products are added daily to the
corresponding collections. Such datasets cannot be made accessible to users via full-catalog download. Space agencies
and other data providers often offer access to their data catalogs through interactive Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs),
see for instance the [Copernicus Open Access Hub portal](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home) for the Sentinel
missions. Accessing data via a GUI is a nice way to explore a catalog and get familiar with its content, but it
represents a heavy and error-prone task that should be avoided if carried out systematically to retrieve data.

A service that offers programmatic access to the data enables users to reach the desired data in a more reliable,
scalable and reproducible manner. An important element in the software interface exposed to the users, which is generally called
the Application Programming Interface (API), is the use of standards. Standards, in fact, can significantly facilitate
the reusability of tools and scripts across datasets and applications.

The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification is an emerging standard for describing geospatial data. By
organizing metadata in a form that adheres to the STAC specifications, data providers make it possible for users to
access data from different missions, instruments and collections using the same set of tools.

## Search a STAC catalog

The [STAC browser](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/) is a good starting point to discover available
datasets, as it provides an up-to-date list of existing STAC catalogs. From the list, let's click on the
"Earth Search" catalog, i.e. the access point to search the archive of Sentinel-2 images hosted on AWS.

> ## Exercise: Discover a STAC catalog
> Let's take a moment to explore the Earth Search STAC catalog, which is the catalog indexing the Sentinel-2 collection
> that is hosted on AWS. We can interactively browse this catalog using the STAC browser at [this link](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0).
>
> 1. Open the link in your web browser. Which (sub-)catalogs are available?
> 2. Open the Sentinel-2 L2A COGs collection, and select one item from the list. Each item corresponds to a satellite
> "scene", i.e. a portion of the footage recorded by the satellite at a given time. Have a look at the metadata fields
> and the list of assets. What kind of data do the assets represent?
>
> > ## Solution
> > ![](../fig/E05-02-STAC-browser-exercise.jpg)
> > 1) Four subcatalogs are available, including both Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images (see left screenshot in the figure
> > above).
> >
> > 2) When you select the Sentinel-2 L2A COGs collection, and randomly choose one of the items from the list, you
> > should find yourself on a page similar to the right screenshot in the figure above. On the left side you will find
> > a list of the available assets: overview images (thumbnail and true color images), metadata files and the "real"
> > satellite images, one for each band captured by the Multispectral Instrument on board Sentinel-2.

When opening a catalog with the STAC browser, you can access the API URL by clicking on the "Source" button on the top
right of the page. By using this URL, we have access to the catalog content and, if supported by the catalog, to the
functionality of searching its items. For the Earth Search STAC catalog the API URL is:

~~~
api_url = "https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0"
~~~
{: .language-python}

You can query a STAC API endpoint from Python using the `pystac_client` library:

~~~
from pystac_client import Client

client = Client.open(api_url)
~~~
{: .language-python}

In the following, we ask for scenes belonging to the `sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs` collection. This dataset includes Sentinel-2
data products pre-processed at level 2A (bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance) and saved in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)
format:

~~~
collection = "sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs"  # Sentinel-2, Level 2A, COGs
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs
>
> Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) are regular GeoTIFF files with some additional features that make them ideal to be
> employed in the context of cloud computing and other web-based services. This format builds on the widely-employed
> GeoTIFF format, already introduced in [Episode 1: Introduction to Raster Data]({{site.baseurl}}/01-intro-raster-data/).
> In essence, COGs are regular GeoTIFF files with a special internal structure. One of the features of COGs is that data
> is organized in "blocks" that can be accessed remotely via independent HTTP requests. Data users can thus access the
> only blocks of a GeoTIFF that are relevant for their analysis, without having to download the full file. In addition,
> COGs typically include multiple lower-resolution versions of the original image, called "overviews", which can also be
> accessed independently. By providing this "pyramidal" structure, users that are not interested in the details provided
> by a high-resolution raster can directly access the lower-resolution versions of the same image, significantly saving
> on the downloading time. More information on the COG format can be found [here](https://www.cogeo.org).
{:callout}

We also ask for scenes intersecting a geometry defined using the `shapely` library (in this case, a point):

~~~
from shapely.geometry import Point
point = Point(4.89, 52.37)  # AMS coordinates
~~~
{: .language-python}

Note: at this stage, we are only dealing with metadata, so no image is going to be downloaded yet. But even metadata can
be quite bulky if a large number of scenes match our search! For this reason, we limit the search result to 10 items:

~~~
search = client.search(
    collections=[collection],
    intersects=point,
    max_items=10,
)
~~~
{: .language-python}

We submit the query and find out how many scenes match our search criteria (please note that this output can be different as more data is added to the catalog):

~~~
print(search.matched())
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
630
~~~
{: .output}

Finally, we retrieve the metadata of the search results:
~~~
items = search.get_all_items()
~~~
{: .language-python}

The variable `items` is an `ItemCollection` object. We can check its size by:
~~~
print(len(items))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
10
~~~
{: .output}

which is consistent with the maximum number of items that we have set in the search criteria. We can iterate over
the returned items and print these to show their IDs:

~~~
for item in items:
    print(item)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Item id=S2B_31UFU_20220313_0_L2A>
<Item id=S2A_31UFU_20220311_0_L2A>
<Item id=S2A_31UFU_20220308_0_L2A>
<Item id=S2B_31UFU_20220306_0_L2A>
<Item id=S2B_31UFU_20220303_0_L2A>
<Item id=S2A_31UFU_20220301_0_L2A>
<Item id=S2A_31UFU_20220226_0_L2A>
<Item id=S2B_31UFU_20220224_0_L2A>
<Item id=S2B_31UFU_20220221_0_L2A>
<Item id=S2A_31UFU_20220219_0_L2A>
~~~
{: .output}

Each of the items contains information about the scene geometry, its acquisition time, and other metadata that can be
accessed as a dictionary from the `properties` attribute.

Let's inspect the metadata associated with the first item of the search results:
~~~
item = items[0]
print(item.datetime)
print(item.geometry)
print(item.properties)
~~~
{: .language-python}

# Access the assets

So far we have only discussed metadata - but how can one get to the actual images of a satellite scene (the "assets" in
the STAC nomenclature)? These can be reached via links that are made available through the item's attribute `assets`.

~~~
assets = items[0].assets  # first item's asset dictionary
print(assets.keys())
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
dict_keys(['thumbnail', 'overview', 'info', 'metadata', 'visual', 'B01', 'B02', 'B03', 'B04', 'B05', 'B06', 'B07', 'B08', 'B8A', 'B09', 'B11', 'B12', 'AOT', 'WVP', 'SCL'])
~~~
{: .output}

We can print a minimal description of the available assets:

~~~
for key, asset in assets.items():
    print(f"{key}: {asset.title}")
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
thumbnail: Thumbnail
overview: True color image
info: Original JSON metadata
metadata: Original XML metadata
visual: True color image
B01: Band 1 (coastal)
B02: Band 2 (blue)
B03: Band 3 (green)
B04: Band 4 (red)
B05: Band 5
B06: Band 6
B07: Band 7
B08: Band 8 (nir)
B8A: Band 8A
B09: Band 9
B11: Band 11 (swir16)
B12: Band 12 (swir22)
AOT: Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT)
WVP: Water Vapour (WVP)
SCL: Scene Classification Map (SCL)
~~~
{: .output}

Among the others, assets include multiple raster data files (one per optical band, as acquired by the multi-spectral
instrument), a thumbnail, a true-color image ("visual"), instrument metadata and scene-classification information
("SCL"). Let's get the URL links to the actual asset:

~~~
print(assets["thumbnail"].href)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
https://roda.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-s2-l1c/tiles/31/U/FU/2020/3/28/0/preview.jpg
~~~
{: .output}

This can be used to download the corresponding file:

![](../fig/E05-03-STAC-s2-preview.jpg)

Remote raster data can be directly opened via the `rioxarray` library. We will
learn more about this library in the next episodes.
~~~
import rioxarray
b01_href = assets["B01"].href
b01 = rioxarray.open_rasterio(b01_href)
print(b01)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~

  * band         (band) int64 1
  * x            (x) float64 6e+05 6.001e+05 6.002e+05 ... 7.097e+05 7.098e+05
  * y            (y) float64 5.9e+06 5.9e+06 5.9e+06 ... 5.79e+06 5.79e+06
    spatial_ref  int64 0
Attributes:
    _FillValue:    0.0
    scale_factor:  1.0
    add_offset:    0.0
~~~
{: .output}

We can then save the data to disk:

~~~
# save image to disk
b01.rio.to_raster("B01.tif")
~~~
{: .language-python}
