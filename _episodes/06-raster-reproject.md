Sometimes we encounter raster datasets that do not "line up" when plotted or
analyzed. Rasters that don't line up are most often in different Coordinate
Reference Systems (CRS), otherwise known as "projections". This episode explains how to line up rasters in different, known CRSs.

## Raster Projection in Python

If you loaded two rasters with different projections in QGIS or ArcGIS, you'd see that they would align since these software reproject "on-the-fly". But with R or Python, you'll need to reproject your data yourself in order to plot or use these rasters together in calculations.

For this episode, we will be working with the Harvard Forest Digital Terrain
Model (DTM). This differs from the surface model data we've been working with so
far in that the digital surface model (DSM) includes the tops of trees, while
the digital terrain model (DTM) shows the ground level beneath the tree canopy. 

Our goal is to get these data into the same projection with the `rioxarray.reproject_match()` function so that
we can use both rasters to calculate tree canopy height, also called a Canopy Height Model (CHM).

First, we need to read in the DSM and DTM rasters.

To view the CRS information for this dataset in the interactive `repr`, click on document icon on the right side of the `spatial_ref` row.

As we showed in [the previous lesson]({{site.baseurl}}/05-raster-structure#view-raster-coordinate-reference-system-crs-in-python), we can also use the `CRS` class from the `pyproj` library to view the CRS:

~~~
from pyproj import CRS

CRS(surface_HARV.rio.crs)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Derived Projected CRS: EPSG:32618>
Name: WGS 84 / UTM zone 18N
Axis Info [cartesian]:
- [east]: Easting (metre)
- [north]: Northing (metre)
Area of Use:
- undefined
Coordinate Operation:
- name: UTM zone 18N
- method: Transverse Mercator
Datum: World Geodetic System 1984
- Ellipsoid: WGS 84
- Prime Meridian: Greenwich
~~~
{: .output}

We can see the datum and projection are UTM zone 18N and WGS 84 respectively. UTM zone 18N is a regional projection with an associated coordinate system to more accurately capture distance, shape and/or area around the Harvard Forest.

~~~
CRS(terrain_HARV.rio.crs)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<Geographic 2D CRS: EPSG:4326>
Name: WGS 84
Axis Info [ellipsoidal]:
- Lat[north]: Geodetic latitude (degree)
- Lon[east]: Geodetic longitude (degree)
Area of Use:
- undefined
Datum: World Geodetic System 1984
- Ellipsoid: WGS 84
- Prime Meridian: Greenwich
~~~
{: .output}

We see the DTM is in an unprojected geographic coordinate system, using WGS84 as the datum and a coordinate system that spans the entire planet (i.e. latitude and longitude). This means that every location on the planet is defined using the SAME coordinate system and the same units. Geographic coordinate reference systems are best for global analysis but not for capturing distance, shape and/or area on a local scale.

We can use the CRS attribute from one of our datasets to reproject the other dataset so that they are both in the same projection. The only argument that is required is the `reproject_match` argument, which takes the CRS of the result of the reprojection.

In one line `reproject_match` does a lot of helpful things:
1. It reprojects `terrain_HARV` from WGS 84 to UTM Zone 18.
2. Where `terrain_HARV` has data values and `surface_HARV` does not, the result `terrain_HARV_UTM18` is clipped. Where surface_HARV has data values and `terrain_HARV` does not, the result `terrain_HARV_UTM18` is padded with no data values to match the extent.
3. It sets the no data value of `terrain_HARV` to the no data value for `surface_HARV`

> ## Code Tip
> There also exists a method called `reproject()`, which only reprojects one raster to another projection. If you want more control over how rasters are resampled, clipped, and/or reprojected, you can use the `reproject()` method and other `rioxarray` methods individually.

We can also save our DataArray that we created with `rioxarray` to a file.

```python
reprojected_path = "data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop_UTM18.tif"
terrain_HARV_UTM18.rio.to_raster(reprojected_path)
```

Let's plot our handiwork so far! We can use the `xarray.DataArray.plot` function to show the DTM. But if we run the following code, something doesn't look right ...

```python
terrain_HARV_UTM18.plot(cmap="viridis")
```
<img src="../fig/06-bad-DTM-plot-01.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

> ## Challenge
> Whoops! What did we forget to do to the DTM DataArray before plotting?
>
> > ## Answers
> > Our array has a `nodata` value, `-9999.0`, which causes the color
> > of our plot to be stretched over too wide a range. We'd like to
> > only display valid values, so before plotting we can filter out
> > the nodata values using the `where()` function and the 
> > `.rio.nodata` attribute of our DataArray.
> > ```python
terrain_HARV_UTM18_valid = terrain_HARV_UTM18.where(
    terrain_HARV_UTM18  != terrain_HARV_UTM18.rio.nodata)
terrain_HARV_UTM18_valid.plot(cmap="viridis")
> > ```
> > <img src="../fig/06-HARV-reprojected-DTM-02.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
> > If we had saved `terrain_HARV_UTM18` to a file and then read it in with `open_rasterio`'s `masked=True` argument, the raster's `nodata` value would be masked and we would not need to use the `where()` function to do the masking before plotting.

> There are many ways to improve this plot. Matplotlib offers lots of different functions to change the position and
> appearance of plot elements. To plot with Matplotlib, you need to import the `pyplot` module. 
> Something that would really improve our figure is adding a title. This can be done with the `plt.title()` function.

> ## Customizing plots with Matplotlib
> 
> Now that you've added a title to your plot, look for other ways to customize your plot with Matplotlib. One possible way
> to quickly customize a plot is with the `plt.style.use()` function. You can check available styles with `plt.style.available`.
> 
> Another useful function for the plots we are making is `plt.ticklabel_format(style="plain")`. This will ensure that our
> ticks are not truncated, making our plot nicer.
> 
> Try customizing your plot with the functions above or any other `pyplot` parameter.
> 
> > ## Styles and formatting
> >  Here is the result of using a ggplot like style for our digital terrain plot.

> ## Challenge: Reproject, then Plot a Digital Terrain Model
> Create 2 maps in a UTM projection of the [San Joaquin Experimental Range](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER) field site, using the`SJER_dtmCrop.tif` and `SJER_dsmCrop_WGS84.tif` files. Use `rioxarray` and `matplotlib.pyplot` (to add a title). Reproject the data as necessary to make sure each map is in the same UTM projection and save the reprojected file with the file name "data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/SJER/DSM/SJER_dsmCrop_WGS84.tif".
>
> > ## Answers
> > If we read in these files with the argument `masked=True`, then the nodata values will be masked automatically and set to `numpy.nan`, or Not a Number. This can make plotting easier since only valid raster values will be shown. However, it's important to remember that `numpy.nan` values still take up space in our raster just like `nodata` values, and thus they still affect the shape of the raster. Rasters need to be the same shape for raster math to work in Python. In the next lesson, we will examine how to prepare rasters of different shapes for calculations.
