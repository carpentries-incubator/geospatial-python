Sometimes we encounter raster datasets that do not "line up" when plotted or
analyzed. Rasters that don't line up are most often in different Coordinate
Reference Systems (CRS), otherwise known as "projections". This episode explains how to line up rasters in different, known CRSs.

## Raster Projection in R

If you loaded two rasters with different projections in QGIS 3 or ArcMap/ArcPro, you'd see that they would align since these software reproject "on-the-fly". But with R or Python, you'll need to reproject your data yourself in order to plot or use these rasters together in calculations.

For this episode, we will be working with the Harvard Forest Digital Terrain Model (DTM). This differs from the digital surface model (DSM) data we've been working with in that the DTM shows the ground level beneath the tree canopy, while the DSM includes the tops of trees, other natural features, as well as built features. 

Our goal is to get these data into the same projection with the `rioxarray.reproject()` function so that
we can use both rasters to calculate tree canopy height, also called a Canopy Height Model (CHM).

First, we need to read in the DSM and DTM rasters.

Reading in the data with xarray looks similar to using `rasterio` directly, but the output is a xarray object called a `DataArray`. You can use a `xarray.DataArray` in calculations just like a numpy array. Calling the variable name of the `DataArray` also prints out all of its metadata information. Geospatial information is not read in if you don't import rioxarray before calling the `open_rasterio` function.

```python
import rioxarray

surface_HARV = rioxarray.open_rasterio("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")
terrain_HARV = rioxarray.open_rasterio("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop_WGS84.tif")

surface_HARV
```

We can use the CRS attribute from one of our datasets to reproject the other dataset so that they are both in the same projection. The only argument that is required is the `dst_crs` argument, which takes the CRS of the result of the reprojection.

```python
terrain_HARV_UTM18 = terrain_HARV.rio.reproject(dst_crs=surface_HARV.rio.crs)

terrain_HARV_UTM18 
```

> ## Data Tip
> You might wonder why the result of `terrain_HARV.rio.reproject()` shows `-9999` at the edges whereas when we read in the data, 
`surface_HARV` did not show the `-9999` values. This is because xarray by default will wait until the last necessary moment before actually running the computations on an xarray DataArray. This form of evaluation is called lazy, as opposed to eager, where functions are always computed when they are called. If you ever want a lazy DataArray to reveal it's underlying values, you can use the `.compute()` function. `rioxarray` will only show the values in the corners of the array.

And we can also save our DataArray that we created with `rioxarray` to a file.

```python
reprojected_path = "data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop_UTM18.tif"
terrain_HARV_UTM18.rio.to_raster(reprojected_path)
```

Let's plot our handiwork so far! We can use the `xarray.DataArray.plot` function to show the DTM. But if we run the following code, something doesn't look right ...

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure()
terrain_HARV_UTM18.plot(cmap="viridis")
plt.title("Harvard Forest Digital Terrain Model")
```
<img src="../fig/06-bad-DTM-plot-01.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

> ## Challenge
> Whoops! What did we forget to do to the DTM DataArray before plotting?

> > the nodata values using the `where()` function and the 
> > `.rio.nodata` attribute of our DataArray.
> > ```python
terrain_HARV_UTM18_valid = terrain_HARV_UTM18.where(
    terrain_HARV_UTM18  != terrain_HARV_UTM18.rio.nodata)
plt.figure()
terrain_HARV_UTM18_valid.plot(cmap="viridis")
plt.title("Harvard Forest Digital Terrain Model")

> > If we had saved `terrain_HARV_UTM18 ` to a file and then read it in with `open_rasterio`'s `masked=True` argument the raster's `nodata` value would be masked and we would not need to use the `where()` function to do the masking before plotting.

> ## Challenge: Reproject, then Plot a Digital Terrain Model
> Create 2 maps in a UTM projection of the [San Joaquin Experimental Range](https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER) field site, using the`SJER_dtmCrop.tif` and `SJER_dsmCrop_WGS84.tif` files. Use `rioxarray` and `matplotlib.pyplot` (to add a title). Reproject the data as necessary to make sure each map is in the same UTM projection and save the reprojected file with the file name "data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/SJER/DSM/SJER_dsmCrop_WGS84.tif".
>
> > ## Answers
> > If we read in these files with the argument `masked=True`, then the nodata values will be masked automatically and set to `numpy.nan`, or Not a Number. This can make plotting easier since only valid raster values will be shown. However, it's important to remember that `numpy.nan` values still take up space in our raster just like `nodata` values, and thus they still affect the shape of the raster. Rasters need to be the same shape for raster math to work in python. In the next lesson, we will examine how to prepare rasters of different shapes for calculations.
